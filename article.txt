Instruments?
 So then you start creating the world which instruments do you need ?
 Let`s pretend we already created world. Empty shell filed with void.
 How do you plan to create all this perfection around you ?
 With what instruments you pull out all your thoughts from head and squize it in your world borders ? So first you should create rules! And next instruments which force this rulels to your Universe. Next you can create eyes to observe perfection you have delivered to existence...
Rules?
 So the rules. Simplest Universe I can imagiene consist of dots.
 0 dimension just dots miriads indistinguishable and not existend dots. 
 1 dimension so now they have 1 parameter and we should deside quantization, lets it be numbers 1,2,3....
 2 dimension now they have two parameters and we can work with them more fannier.
 3 dimension they almost humans.
 And satic dots are nice but we should add rules.
Tools to add rules?
 Now I think about this abstract world -> empty with dots which has dimensions. And set of rules what say in witch way this dimensions are changed. So I can work with this now

Also world is complex struct. and PC is amaizing tool to work with.
I like to write things down and do not like reread it.
So I need simple interface to world of information.
I like to write down words I need only little help to reread it.
So I can make up self dialogue. 
and for first we already have set of tools for this.
Files and text editors. you do not need any new things for this.
What I need is little game plan for my life.
So I can build happy free lifestyle.
What I need to be happy ?
1. I need fredom to do what I want.
2. I need place to stay.
3. I need supply that place with all I need for one year.

So what I search is place where you can satisfy basic hunam needs.
And all you need to do is do what you want.
